                                                Understanding the Linux Kernel (Third Edition)
Linux kernel version : 2.6

Chapter 1 : Introducation
    Linux joins System V Release 4 (SVR4),developed by AT&T.
    other UNIX OS or UNIX-like OS :
      4.4 BSD
      Digital UNIX
      AIX
      HP-UX
      Solaris
      Mac OS X
      ...

      (opensource)
      FreeBSD
      NetBSD
      OpenBSD
      Linux
      ...

    The common attributes between Linux and well-known commercial Unix kernels :
      monolithic kernel
      compiled and statically linked traditional Unix kernels
      (of course support module for dynamically load and unload)
      kernel threading
      multithreaded application support(lightweight process LWP supporting)
      preemptive kernel
      multiprocessor support(SMP)
      filesystem

      streams(but Linux has no analogue to the STREAMS I/O subsystem introduced in SVR4)  

    The advantages of Linux :
      Linux is cost-free
      Linux is fully customizable in all its components
      Linux runs on low-end,inexpensive hardware platforms
      Linux is powerful
      Linux developers are excellent programmers
      The linux kernel can be very small and compact
      Linux is highly compatible with many common operating systems
      Linux is well supported

    Basic Operating System Concepts :
      the operating system must fulfill two main objectives :
        >  interact with the hardware components,servicing all low-level programmable elements
	   included in the hardware platform.
	>  provide an execution environment to the applications that run on the computer system.
	
      modern OS does not allow user program interact with hardware directly and forbid them to
      access arbitrary memory locations.
      in particular,the hardware introduces at least two different execution modes for the CPU :
        a nonprivileged mode for user programs
	a privileged mode for the kernel
	/*  UNIX calls these
	 *    User Mode and Kernel Mode
	 */

    Multiuser Systems :
      A multiuser system is a computer that is able to concurrently and independently execute several
      applications belonging to two or more users.

      Concurrently :
        applications can be active at the same time and contend for various resources such as CPU,memory,
	hard disks,and so on.
      Independently :
        each application can perform its task with no concern for what the applications of the other uses are
	doing.

      Multiuser operating systems must include several features :
        >  An authentication mechanism for verifying the user's identify
	>  A protection mechanism against buggy user programs that could block other applications running 
	   in the system
	>  A protection mechanism against malicious user programs that could interfere with or spy on the 
	   activity of other users
	>  An accounting mechanism that limits the amount of resource units assigned to each user

      To ensure safe protection mechanisms,operating systems must use the hardware protection associated 
      with the CPU privileged mode.
      Unix is a multiuser system that enforces the hardware protection of system resources.

    Users and Groups :
      in a multiuser system,each user has a private space on the machine,the operating system must ensure that
      the private portion of a user space is visible only to its owner.Unix-like system use UserID or UID as
      user identifier,it is a unique number.
      to selectively share material with other users,each user is a member of one or more user groups,which 
      are identified by a unique number called a user group ID.each file is associated with exactly one group.
      any Unix-like operating system has a special user called root or superuser,the root user can do almost
      everything,because the operating system does not apply the usual protection mechanism to it.

    Processes :
      A process can be defined either as "an instance of a program in execution" or  as the "execution context"
      of a running program.
      in traditional operating systems,a process executes a single sequence of instructions in an address space;
      the address space is the set of memory addresses that the process is allowed to reference.

      multiple processes environment :
        in modern operating system allow processes with multiple execution flows,that is,multiple sequences
	of instructions executed in the same address space.
	system that allow concurent active processes are said to be multiprogramming or multiprocessing.

	multiuser systems must enforce an multiple processes environment,but some multiprocessing operating
	systems are not multiuser.

	it is important to distinguish programs from processes;several processes can execute the same program
	concurently,while the same process can execute several programs sequentially.

	scheduler is an important system compoent in multiprocessing system,which process should be hold the 
	CPU to execute is determined by scheduler.
	
	preemptable :
	  some operating systems allow only nonpreemptable processes,which means that the scheduler is invoked
	  only when a process voluntarily relinquishes the CPU.but process of a multiuser system must be
	  preemptable.

	  UNIX is a multiuer and multiprocessing operating system with  preemptable processes.

	UNIX-like operating systems adopt a process/kernel model.each process has the illusion that it is the
	only process on the machine,and it has exclusive access to the operating system services.

    Kernel Architecture :
      monolithic kernel,each kernel layer is integrated into the whole kernel program and runs in Kernel Mode
      on behalf of the current process.

      microkernel operating systems demand a very small set of functions from the kernel,generally including a 
      few synchronization primitives,a simple scheduler,and an interprocess communication mechanism.
      several system processes that run on top of the microkernel implement other operating system layer functions,
      like memory allocators,device drivers,and system call handlers.

      comparison between monolithic kernel and microkernel :
        1>  microkernel is slower than monolithic kernel,because kernel layer communication has a cost.
	2>  microkernel force the system programmers to adopt a modularized approach,that means microkernel
	    is very modularized.every relativly kernel layer is independent program that must interact with
	    the other layers through well-defined and clean software interfaces.
	3>  microkernel can be easily ported to other architectures fairly easily.all hardware-dependent components
	    are generally encapsulated in the microkernel code.
        4>  microkernel tend to make better use of random access memory than monolithic kernel,system processes
	    that are not implementing needed functionalities might be swapped out or destroyed.

      UNIX and UNIX-like operating system almost satisfy all advantages of microkernel.

      the main advantages of using modules include :
        >  a modularized approach.
	>  platform independence
	>  frugal main memory usage
	>  no performance penalty
